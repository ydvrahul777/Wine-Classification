# Wine-Classification

📌 Wine Classification & Clustering: Analyzing Chemical Composition
🔍 Overview
This project focuses on clustering wines based on their chemical constituents and predicting cluster labels using supervised learning. The dataset consists of wines from three different cultivars, analyzed for 13 chemical properties.

🛠 Key Objectives
✅ Perform unsupervised clustering to group wines based on chemical properties.
✅ Use classification algorithms to predict cluster labels.
✅ Analyze feature importance and insights from chemical composition.

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes wine samples from a specific region in Italy, categorized by chemical analysis into three cultivars.

🚀 Techniques Used
🔹 K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
🔹 Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and other classification models
🔹 Feature Scaling & Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

🌐 Live Deployment
This project is deployed using Streamlit, allowing interactive wine classification.
